> *Note:* If you have not already you will need to install XAMP to run SQL and php on your localmachine. My server will mirrior the set up of XAMP so it is very important you use this. There are about a half billion tutorials online on how to use XAMP so just youtube it if you don't know how to use it.

So I am going to post some more documentation later this week but so far I have a quick and dirty working version of a table to waiter interaction for the demo that is due on sunday or whatever.
