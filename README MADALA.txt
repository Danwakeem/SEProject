Project info

Our project is a php application and I know you are pretty familiar with php so you know the drill but I am going to go ahead and out line the steps to put together and run our application just incase we did something weird or it is unclear.

Steps to run the application on localhost

1) Our database injection script in located in the GroupResources folder. (It should be called MADALA_SQL_TESTING_SCRIPT.sql)
2) Place the project in your XAMP (Or whatever you use) htdocs folder
3) Go to localhost:8888/SEProject/index.php

Here are the three URLs that will run our testing scripts:

localhost:8888/SEProject/UnitTest.php
localhost:8888/SEProject/integrationTestJS.php
localhost:8888/SEProject/integrationTestsPHP.php
