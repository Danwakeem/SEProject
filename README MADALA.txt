Project info

Our project demo is a simple login and customer to waiter notification system. 

Our project is a php application and I know you are pretty familiar with php so you know the drill but I am going to go ahead and out line the steps to put together and run our application just incase we did something weird or it is unclear.

Steps to run the application on localhost

1) Our database injection script in located in the GroupResources folder. (It should be the only thing in there)
2) Place the project in your XAMP (Or whatever you use) htdocs folder
3) Go to localhost:8888/SEProject/index.php

Steps to demo the functionality

1) After visiting the website you just set up go login in two browser windows (One regualr web browser and one incognito window) with the following credentials
	Browser 1: username - Dodo
			   password - password
	Browser 2: username - table3
			   password - table3
2) In the customer Browswer (table3) hit the button in the menu bar to alert the waiter.
3) Once the waiter has been alerted you can dissmiss the notification sent by the customer by hitting the done button next to the view bill button.
